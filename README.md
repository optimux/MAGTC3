# MAGTC^3
MAGTC^3 is Thermo-Chemical Convection Coupled Model for Magma Dynamics.
This model solves a general group of mass, species, energy and momentum conservation equations by Finite Volume Method, with following features:
(1)density change due to temperature, composition and phase change;
(2)variable viscosity, i.e., non-Newtonian fluid;
(3)porus media or mushy region, handled by Darcy law;
(4)chemical diffusion in liquid;
(5)latent heat from phase change;
(6)thermodynamic equilibrium between liquid and different solid phases;
(7)crystal movement;
(8)crystal capture or escape;
(9)solidification front critical shear strength from collapsing.
